    "### TF-IDF Vectorization\n",
    "TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) is a numerical statistic that reflects the importance of a term in a document within a collection or corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TF-IDF value of a term is calculated by multiplying two factors: term frequency (TF) and inverse document frequency (IDF).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Term Frequency (TF): Term frequency measures the frequency of a term within a document. It is calculated by dividing the number of occurrences of a term in a document by the total number of terms in that document. \n",
    "\n",
    "- TF(t, d) = (Number of occurrences of term t in document d) / (Total number of terms in document d)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. verse Document Frequency (IDF): Inverse document frequency measures the rarity of a term across the entire corpus. It is calculated by taking the logarithm of the total number of documents divided by the number of documents containing the term. \n",
    "\n",
    "- IDF(t) = log((Total number of documents) / (Number of documents containing term t))\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we have the TF and IDF values for each term in a document, we can calculate the TF-IDF value by multiplying them together:\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF(t, d) = TF(t, d) * IDF(t)\n",
    "\n",
    "In our project, we are using TF-IDF to vectorize textual data. Vectorization is the process of converting text into numerical vectors that machine learning algorithms can understand. By representing documents as TF-IDF vectors, we can capture the importance of different terms within each document and compare documents based on their content."

    "### Cosine Similarity Explanation: \n",
    "Cosine similarity is a measure of similarity between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. It calculates the cosine of the angle between the two vectors, which represents their similarity. The value of cosine similarity ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 indicates that the vectors are identical, 0 indicates that the vectors are orthogonal (completely dissimilar), and -1 indicates that the vectors are diametrically opposed. To calculate the cosine similarity, you need to compute the dot product of the two vectors and divide it by the product of their magnitudes.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of this project, we are representing the textual preferences of the user and repositories as vectors. Each vector represents the frequency or presence of certain words or features in the textual data. By calculating the cosine similarity between the user's entered textual preference vector and the repository vectors, we can determine how similar they are. Then we rank repos by similarity score and recommend the top few ones."
